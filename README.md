Assignment Lab 2

-	Create a comment header as in lab 1, with your **name, description, and date**.  Your description might contain a comment like, “beginning program demonstrating how to define variables of different types and how do display what is stored in each variable.”  (Here is also where you would credit anyone who assisted you.)
-	Create a boolean value called “isTrue” and set it to false.
-	Create a double variable called “money” and set it to 99999.99
-	Create two integer variables called "num1" and "num2".
-	Print the value stored in “money” first.
-	Then print the value stored in “isTrue” without skipping to the next line but placing a space between the two values.
-	Finally, print the sum of num1 & num2, using the variable names, not specific values.
